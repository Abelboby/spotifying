## 🤖 About the Bot

Our WhatsApp bot is like that friend who's really good at remembering who owes what:

- Reads bank SMS faster than your friends read payment reminders

- Keeps track of who paid and who's "waiting for their salary"

- [ ] Integration with your friends' calendar to block their Netflix time until they pay
- [ ] Quantum encryption for storing payment promises (they tend to quantum tunnel away)
